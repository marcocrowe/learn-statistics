## Question 1

### Question 1.A

A researcher wants to know if the Irish public are in support of a new government policy. He believes that less than 30% of the public support it and wishes to carry out a survey to test this hypothesis. From a list of individuals living in his area he draws a random sample of 80 individuals and finds that 23 are in favour.

#### Question 1.A.1 (1 Mark)

What is the population?

#### Answer 1.A.1

#### Question 1.A.2 (1 Mark)

Identify any potential bias.

#### Question 1.A.3 (2 Marks)

Identify the parameter and statistic - give the symbol and value for both.

### Question 1.B

The melting points (C) of n =50 alloy filaments is investigated yielding T= 320.1 and
s = 6.75. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean melting point p.

### Question 1.C (5 Marks)

A cereal manufacturer packages cereal in boxes with a 500g label weight. Suppose that the
actual distribution of weights is $N(\mu = 500, \sigma^2 = 2.1)$.

#### Question 1.C.1 (3 Marks)

What percentage of the boxes have cereal weighing over 500g?

#### Question 1.C.2 (3 Marks)

If n = 5 boxes are selected at random compute $Pr(\overline{X} \leq 499.5)$.
