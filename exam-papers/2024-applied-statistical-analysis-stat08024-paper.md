## Question 1

### Question 1.A

A researcher wants to know if the Irish public are in support of a new government policy. He believes that less than 30% of the public support it and wishes to carry out a survey to test this hypothesis. From a list of individuals living in his area he draws a random sample of 80 individuals and finds that 23 are in favour.

#### Question 1.A.1 (1 Mark)

What is the population?

#### Answer 1.A.1

The population is the Irish public.

#### Question 1.A.2 (1 Mark)

Identify any potential bias.

#### Answer 1.A.2

The researcher has drawn a sample from a list of individuals living in his area. This may introduce bias as the sample may not be representative of the Irish public.  A better approach would be to use a random sample of the Irish public, i.e. a few people from each county (area).

#### Question 1.A.3 (2 Marks)

Identify the parameter and statistic - give the symbol and value for both.

#### Answer 1.A.3

- **Parameter (Population Proportion)**: The parameter is the true proportion of the Irish public who support the new government policy.
  - **Symbol**: $p$
  - **Value**: Unknown, but the researcher hypothesizes it to be $p_0 = 0.30$ (30%).

- **Statistic (Sample Proportion)**: The statistic is the proportion of the sampled individuals who support the new government policy.
  - **Symbol**: $\hat{p}$
  - **Value**: $\hat{p} = 0.2875$ (28.75%).

### Question 1.B (5 Marks)

The melting points (C) of n=50 alloy filaments is investigated yielding T= 320.1 and
s = 6.75. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean melting point p.

#### Answer 1.B

<details>
<summary>Choosing a Distribution</summary>

To determine whether to use the **t-distribution** or the **z-distribution** for calculating the confidence interval, you need to consider two factors:

1. **Sample Size**:
   - For **large sample sizes** (typically $n \geq 30$), the **z-distribution** (normal distribution) is usually used to calculate the confidence interval, because the Central Limit Theorem ensures that the sample mean will be normally distributed.
   - For **small sample sizes** (typically $n < 30$), the **t-distribution** is used because the t-distribution accounts for the additional uncertainty that comes with estimating the population standard deviation $\sigma$ using the sample standard deviation $s$.

2. **Use of Sample Standard Deviation**:

   - When the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is **unknown** and the sample size is relatively small, the **t-distribution** is more appropriate because it adjusts for the additional variability that comes with estimating $\sigma$ using $s$.
   - Even for **larger samples** (like $n = 50$), if you are using the sample standard deviation $s$ instead of the population standard deviation $\sigma$, the **t-distribution** is still the more accurate approach.

Why use the t-distribution in this case?  

In your problem:

- The **sample size $n = 50$** is relatively large, but the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is **unknown** (you are given the sample standard deviation $s = 6.75$).
- Since you are using the **sample standard deviation $s$**, it is safer to use the **t-distribution** rather than the z-distribution.

Thus, you would calculate the confidence interval using the formula:

$$\bar{x} \pm t_{v,\alpha/2} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

because the sample size, though not extremely small, still warrants the use of the **t-distribution** due to the reliance on the sample standard deviation.

</details>

- Sample size $n = 50$
- Mean $\bar{x} = 320.1$
- Standard deviation $s = 6.75$
- Confidence level $1 - \alpha = 0.95$

The confidence interval for the mean melting point $\mu$ is given by:

$$
\bar{x} \pm t_{v,\alpha/2} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

Where $t_{v,\alpha/2}$ is the critical value from the t-distribution with $v = n - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49$ degrees of freedom and $\alpha/2 = (1 - 0.95)/2 = 0.025$.  

The critical value $t_{v,\alpha/2}$ can be found using a t-table or a statistical calculator. For a 95% confidence level and 49 degrees of freedom, the critical value is approximately $2.0096$.

<details>
<summary>Calculating a Confidence Interval not in the t-table</summary>
To use **linear interpolation** for estimating the critical value of $t_{49,\alpha/2}$, we'll use the nearest critical values from the t-distribution table for $v = 40$ and $v = 60$. Here are the steps:

Step 1. Identify known values from the t-distribution table:

- For $v = 40$ and $\alpha/2 = 0.025$ (95% confidence level):
  - $t_{40,\alpha/2} = 2.021$
- For $v = 60$ and $\alpha/2 = 0.025$:
  - $t_{60,\alpha/2} = 2.000$

We want to estimate the value for $v = 49$.

Step 2: Set up the linear interpolation formula  

To find the critical value for $v = 49$, we can set up a proportion:

$t_{49} = t_{40} + \left( \frac{49 - 40}{60 - 40} \right) \times (t_{60} - t_{40})$

Where:

- $t_{49}$ is the estimated critical value we want.
- $t_{40}$ and $t_{60}$ are the known critical values.
- $49 - 40$ is the difference between 49 and 40.
- $60 - 40$ is the total difference between the degrees of freedom.

Step 3: Plug in the values and calculate

Let's calculate the interpolated value.

It seems like I canâ€™t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

However, you can follow the formula and plug in the numbers manually:

$t_{49} = 2.021 + \left( \frac{49 - 40}{60 - 40} \right) \times (2.000 - 2.021)$

This should give you an interpolated value close to $2.0096$, matching the exact calculation.
</details>

Substitute the values into the formula:

$320.1 \pm 2.0096 \times \dfrac{6.75}{\sqrt{50}} = $  
$320.1 \pm 2.0096 \times \dfrac{6.75}{7.0711} = $
$320.1 \pm 1.92 = $
$[318.18, 322.02]$

$\text{The 95\% confidence interval for the mean melting point is \boxed{[318.18, 322.02]}}$

### Question 1.C (5 Marks)

A cereal manufacturer packages cereal in boxes with a 500g label weight. Suppose that the
actual distribution of weights is $N(\mu = 500, \sigma^2 = 2.1)$.

#### Answer 1.C

#### Question 1.C.1 (3 Marks)

What percentage of the boxes have cereal weighing over 500g?

#### Answer 1.C.1

#### Question 1.C.2 (3 Marks)

If n = 5 boxes are selected at random compute $Pr(\overline{X} \leq 499.5)$.

#### Answer 1.C.2

To solve the questions, we'll use the properties of the normal distribution.

1. **Determine the probability:**

   Since the distribution of weights is $N(500, 2.1)$, we want to find $P(X > 500)$.

   We can standardize this to the standard normal distribution:
   \[
   Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
   \]
   where $X$ is the weight of a box, \(\mu = 500\), and \(\sigma = \sqrt{2.1}\).

   For $X = 500$:
   \[
   Z = \frac{500 - 500}{\sqrt{2.1}} = \frac{0}{\sqrt{2.1}} = 0
   \]

   The standard normal variable $Z$ for $X = 500$ is 0. 

   The probability that $X$ is greater than 500 grams is:
   \[
   P(X > 500) = P(Z > 0)
   \]

2. **Use the standard normal distribution:**

   In the standard normal distribution, $P(Z > 0)$ is 0.5, because the normal distribution is symmetric around 0.

   Therefore:
   \[
   P(X > 500) = 0.5
   \]

3. **Convert to percentage:**

   \[
   \text{Percentage} = 0.5 \times 100\% = 50\%
   \]

   **Answer 1.C.1:** 50% of the boxes have cereal weighing over 500g.

### Question 1.C.2

**If $n = 5$ boxes are selected at random, compute $Pr(\overline{X} \leq 499.5)$.**

1. **Determine the distribution of the sample mean:**

   The sample mean \(\overline{X}\) for \(n\) boxes follows a normal distribution:
   \[
   \overline{X} \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right)
   \]

   Given \(\mu = 500\), \(\sigma^2 = 2.1\), and \(n = 5\):
   \[
   \overline{X} \sim N\left(500, \frac{2.1}{5}\right)
   \]

   The variance of \(\overline{X}\) is \(\frac{2.1}{5}\) and the standard deviation is \(\sqrt{\frac{2.1}{5}}\).

   \[
   \sigma_{\overline{X}} = \sqrt{\frac{2.1}{5}} \approx \sqrt{0.42} \approx 0.648
   \]

2. **Standardize the sample mean:**

   We need to find:
   \[
   P(\overline{X} \leq 499.5)
   \]

   Standardize this to the standard normal distribution:
   \[
   Z = \frac{\overline{X} - \mu}{\sigma_{\overline{X}}}
   \]

   For \(\overline{X} = 499.5\):
   \[
   Z = \frac{499.5 - 500}{0.648} \approx \frac{-0.5}{0.648} \approx -0.771
   \]

3. **Use the standard normal distribution:**

   Find the probability $P(Z \leq -0.771)$ using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator:

   \[
   P(Z \leq -0.771) \approx 0.220
   \]

   **Answer 1.C.2:** $Pr(\overline{X} \leq 499.5) \approx 0.220$ or 22.0%.

### Question 1.D (5 Marks)

$A \sim t_{11}. \text {Given }\Gamma(5.5)=52.34$, calculate $f(a=1)$.

### Answer 1.D

Sure, let's format the calculations correctly and ensure the steps are clear for the PDF calculation of the t-distribution at \(a = 1\) with 11 degrees of freedom.

### Calculation of the PDF for \(A \sim t_{11}\) at \(a = 1\)

The probability density function (PDF) of the t-distribution with \(\nu\) degrees of freedom is given by:

\[
f(a) = \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{\nu + 1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\nu \pi} \Gamma\left(\frac{\nu}{2}\right)} \left(1 + \frac{a^2}{\nu}\right)^{-\frac{\nu + 1}{2}}
\]

Given:
- Degrees of freedom \(\nu = 11\)
- We need to calculate \(f(a = 1)\)

### Step 1: Substitute into the formula

The PDF at \(a = 1\) is:

\[
f(1) = \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{11 + 1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{11 \pi} \Gamma\left(\frac{11}{2}\right)} \left(1 + \frac{1^2}{11}\right)^{-\frac{11 + 1}{2}}
\]

Simplify to:

\[
f(1) = \frac{\Gamma(6)}{\sqrt{11 \pi} \Gamma(5.5)} \left(\frac{12}{11}\right)^{-6}
\]

### Step 2: Use the provided values

We are given:
- \(\Gamma(5.5) = 52.34\)
- $\Gamma(x) = (x-1)!$ for integer x
- \(\Gamma(6) = 5! = 120\)

### Step 3: Compute the value

1. **Calculate \(\sqrt{11 \pi}\)**

   \[
   \sqrt{11 \pi} = \sqrt{11 \times 3.1416} \approx \sqrt{34.5576} \approx 5.879
   \]

2. **Calculate \(\left(\frac{12}{11}\right)^{-6}\)**

   \[
   \frac{12}{11} \approx 1.0909
   \]
   \[
   \left(\frac{12}{11}\right)^{-6} \approx \left(1.0909\right)^{-6} \approx 0.665
   \]

3. **Substitute into the PDF formula**

   \[
   f(1) = \frac{120}{5.879 \times 52.34} \times 0.665
   \]

   Calculate the denominator:

   \[
   5.879 \times 52.34 \approx 307.47
   \]

   Then:

   \[
   \frac{120}{307.47} \approx 0.389
   \]
   \[
   f(1) = 0.389 \times 0.665 \approx 0.259
   \]

$$\boxed{f(1) \approx 0.259}$$

### Question 1.E (5 Marks)

Consider the following joint distribution:

| p(x,y) | x=0  | x=1  | x=2  |
|--------|------|------|------|
| y=1    | 0.1  | `?`  | 0.25 |
| y=2    | 0.05 | 0.15 | 0.25 |

Complete the table and calculate $p(x=1), p(y=1)$

### Answer 1.E

To complete the joint distribution table and calculate the marginal probabilities \( p(x=1) \) and \( p(y=1) \), follow these steps:

1. **Complete the Joint Distribution Table**

   Given the joint distribution:

   | p(x,y) | 0    | 1    | 2    |
   |--------|------|------|------|
   | 0      | 0.1  | ?    | 0.25 |
   | 1      | 0.05 | 0.15 | 0.25 |

   The sum of all joint probabilities should be 1:

   \[
   \text{Sum} = 0.1 + ? + 0.25 + 0.05 + 0.15 + 0.25
   \]

   First, calculate the sum of known values:

   \[
   0.1 + 0.25 + 0.05 + 0.15 + 0.25 = 0.8
   \]

   So, the sum of the unknown value \( ? \) should be:

   \[
   1 - 0.8 = 0.2
   \]

   Since the joint distribution table should sum to 1, and we have:

   \[
   0.1 + ? + 0.25 + 0.05 + 0.15 + 0.25 = 1
   \]

   The value of \( ? \) is:

   \[
   ? = 0.2
   \]

   | p(x,y) | x=0  | x=1  | x=2  |          |
   |--------|------|------|------|----------|
   | y=1    | 0.1  | `x`  | 0.25 | `y`      |
   | y=2    | 0.05 | 0.15 | 0.25 | 0.45     |
   |        | 0.15 | `z`  | 0.5  | **1.00** |

$y+0.45=1 \therefore y=0.55$  
$0.15+z+0.5=1 \therefore z=0.35$

   | p(x,y) | x=0  | x=1      | x=2  |          |
   |--------|------|----------|------|----------|
   | y=1    | 0.1  | `x`      | 0.25 | **0.55** |
   | y=2    | 0.05 | 0.15     | 0.25 | 0.45     |
   |        | 0.15 | **0.35** | 0.5  | **1.00** |

$x + 0.15 = 0.35 \therefore x = 0.2$  

Alternatively,  
$0.1+x+0.25 = 0.55 \therefore x = 0.2$  

   Thus, the completed table is:

   | p(x,y) | x=0  | x=1  | x=2  |      |
   |--------|------|------|------|------|
   | y=1    | 0.1  | 0.2  | 0.25 | 0.55 |
   | y=2    | 0.05 | 0.15 | 0.25 | 0.45 |
   |        | 0.15 | 0.35 | 0.5  | 1.00 |

1. **Calculate Marginal Probabilities**

   - **For \( p(x=1) \):**

     \[
     p(x=1) = p(x=1, y=0) + p(x=1, y=1) + p(x=1, y=2)
     \]

     Substituting the values:

     \[
     p(x=1) = 0.05 + 0.15 + 0.25 = 0.45
     \]

   - **For \( p(y=1) \):**

     \[
     p(y=1) = p(x=0, y=1) + p(x=1, y=1)
     \]

     Substituting the values:

     \[
     p(y=1) = 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35
     \]

### Summary

- The completed joint distribution table is:

  | p(x,y) | 0    | 1    | 2    |
  |--------|------|------|------|
  | 0      | 0.1  | 0.2  | 0.25 |
  | 1      | 0.05 | 0.15 | 0.25 |

- The marginal probabilities are:

  - \( p(x=1) = 0.45 \)
  - \( p(y=1) = 0.35 \)

## Question 2

### Question 2.A (5 Marks)

Given $n_1 = 110, x_1 = 65$ and $n_2 = 120, x_2= 70$, calculate a 90% confidence interval for the difference in the two proportions. Using the confidence interval, comment on the population proportions.

#### Answer 2.A

To calculate a 90% confidence interval for the difference in two proportions, we follow these steps:

**Step 1: Define the Sample Proportions**  

Given:

- \( n_1 = 110 \) and \( x_1 = 65 \) for the first sample
- \( n_2 = 120 \) and \( x_2 = 70 \) for the second sample

The sample proportions are:

$\hat{p}_1 = \frac{x_1}{n_1} = \frac{65}{110} \approx 0.5909$  
$\hat{p}_2 = \frac{x_2}{n_2} = \frac{70}{120} \approx 0.5833$  
Confidence level:

$$(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) \pm z_{\alpha/2} \times \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}$$

$(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) \approx 0.5909 - 0.5833 = 0.0076$  

The standard error (SE) for the difference between two proportions is:

$\text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1 (1 - \hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2 (1 - \hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}$  

Plugging in the values:
$\text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{0.5909 \times (1 - 0.5909)}{110} + \frac{0.5833 \times (1 - 0.5833)}{120}}$  
$\text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{0.5909 \times 0.4091}{110} + \frac{0.5833 \times 0.4167}{120}}$  
$\text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{0.2418}{110} + \frac{0.2421}{120}}$  
$\text{SE} = \sqrt{0.002198 + 0.002017}$  
$\text{SE} \approx \sqrt{0.004215} \approx 0.0649$  

**Step 4: Determine the Critical Value**

For a 90% confidence interval, the critical value ($z_{\alpha/2}$) is approximately 1.645. given from the standard normal distribution table.

**Step 5: Calculate the Confidence Interval
The confidence interval is given by:

$(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) \pm z_{\alpha/2} \times \text{SE}$  
$0.0076 \pm 1.645 \times 0.0649$  
$0.0076 \pm 0.1061$  

So the 90% confidence interval is:
$0.0076 - 0.1061 \approx -0.0985$  
$0.0076 + 0.1061 \approx 0.1137$  

**Final Confidence Interval**  
$$\boxed{(-0.0985, 0.1137)}$$

The 90% confidence interval for the difference in the two proportions is from -0.0985 to 0.1137.

**Comment on the Population Proportions:**

- The interval includes 0, which suggests that there is no significant difference between the two population proportions at the 90% confidence level.
- This means we cannot conclusively state that one proportion is different from the other based on this interval. The proportions are not significantly different in a statistically significant way, considering the given confidence level.
