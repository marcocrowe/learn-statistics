### Hypothesis Testing

**Test statistic:**

$$
\frac{{\text{{statistic}} - H_0}}{{SE_{\text{{statistic}}}}}
$$

**Note:** In single proportion test, use hypothesized p in SE. For difference in two proportions, replace $\hat{p}_1$ and $\hat{p}_2$ with $\hat{p}_c = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{n_1 + n_2}$.

**F-test:** $F = \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}$ where $s_1^2 > s_2^2$. $F_{\text{cutoff}} = F_{\alpha, \nu_1, \nu_2}$

$$\text{p-value} =
\begin{cases}
2 \times \Pr(A > |a|) & \text{if } H_1 : \mu \neq \mu_0 \\
\Pr(A < a) & \text{if } H_1 : \mu < \mu_0 \\
\Pr(A > a) & \text{if } H_1 : \mu > \mu_0
\end{cases}$$  

### Joint Distributions/Correlation/Regression

$$
E[g(X)] = \int g(x) f(x) dx
$$

For $f(x, y) \geq 0$ where $\int \int f(x, y) dx dy = 1$, $f(x) = \int f(x, y) dy$ and $f(y) = \int f(x, y) dx$.

$$\text{Corr}[X, Y] = \frac{\text{Cov}[X, Y]}{\sqrt{\text{Var}[X] \text{Var}[Y]}} \quad \text{where} \quad \text{Cov}[X, X] = \text{Var}[X] = E[XX] - E[X] E[X]
$$

$$r_{x,y} = \frac{\sum x_i y_i - (\sum x_i)(\sum y_i) / n}{\sqrt{\left[ \sum x_i^2 - (\sum x_i)^2 / n \right] \left[ \sum y_i^2 - (\sum y_i)^2 / n \right]}} = \frac{S_{XY}}{\sqrt{S_{XX} S_{YY}}}$$

$$\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x} \quad \text{where} \quad \hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{S_{XY}}{S_{XX}}$$

$$\sigma_{\hat{\beta}_1} = \sqrt{\frac{SSE}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{s^2}{S_{XX}}} \quad \text{where} \quad s^2 = \frac{1}{n-2}(S_{YY} - \hat{\beta}_1 S_{XY})$$

**Test statistic:**

$$\frac{\hat{\beta}_1}{\sigma_{\hat{\beta}_1}} \sim t_{\alpha/2, n-k-1}$$

## ANOVA

$$SSTO = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{k} Y_{ij}^2 - \frac{(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{k} Y_{ij})^2}{N} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{k} Y_{ij}^2 - NY^2$$

$$SSB = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{(\sum_{j=1}^{n} Y_{ij})^2}{n} - \frac{(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{k} Y_{ij})^2}{N} = n \sum_{i=1}^{k} Y_{i.}^2 - NY^2$$

$$SSW = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{j=1}^{n} Y_{ij}^2 - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \sum_{j=1}^{n} Y_{ij} \right)^2$$
